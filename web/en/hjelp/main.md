Termportalen contains terminological data, which is developed through
a concept-based approach. In this approach, the starting point is a
:ToolTip{label="concept" title="concept" content-id="concept"} and its
meaning. Then, the :ToolTip{label="terms" title="term"
content-id="term"} naming the concept are identified.

The terminological data is presented in :ToolTip{label="terminological
entries" title="terminological entry" content-id="termpost"}. The
entries are organized in separate termbases and connected to a
specific :ToolTip{label="domain" title="domain" content-id="domain"}.

The terminological method differs from the lexicographical method used
in compiling general language dictionaries, which takes the word as
the starting point for describing its meaning.

If you would like to know more about terminological theory and
methods, the :AppLinkContent{desc="Guide to Terminology"
