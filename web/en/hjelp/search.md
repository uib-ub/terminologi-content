To search for terms within a specific subject area, select a
:ToolTip{label="domain" title="domain" content-id="domain" } from the
search menu. You can also limit your search to specific
:ToolTip{label="subdomains" title="subdomain" content-id="subdomain"}
in the search menu.

To search in a specific :ToolTip{label="termbase" title="termbase"
content-id="termbase"}, toggle from domain search to termbase search
and select the termbase from the menu.

Additionally, you can search directly from the termbase pages, which
are found under Termbases in the main menu.

::HeadingTp{level="h3"}
Search language and target language
::

Select a search language to see results in that language only. If you
are looking for the translation of a term into another language, you
can select that language as the target language. This returns both the
search language term and the equivalent :ToolTip{label="preferred
term" title="preferred term" content-id="prefLabel"} in the target
language, if available.

::HeadingTp{level="h3"}
Search results and filtering
::

Preferred terms are marked in bold in the results list.

The search results are sorted automatically by their degree of
similarity with the search string. Terms that are a complete match to
the search string are at the top of the list, followed by results
where the search string is part of a :ToolTip{label="compound term"
title="compound term" content-id="multiWordTerm"} or a
:ToolTip{label="complex term" title="complex term"
content-id="complexTerm"}.

You can filter the results by language, the domain or termbase, the
:ToolTip{label="acceptability rating" title="acceptability rating"
content-id="acceptabilityRating"} and the matching pattern by clicking
Filter and checking the relevant options in the filter menu.
