Citing
::

If you want to use a terminological entry as a source, our general
recommendation is to link to the entry itself and to reference the
termbase it belongs to. We also recommend noting the date of
retrieval, as the content of the terminological entries may change.
The format depends on the citation style you are using. In the example
below, the terminological entry is referenced using the Harvard style
format for online encyclopaedias and dictionaries with no authors.
