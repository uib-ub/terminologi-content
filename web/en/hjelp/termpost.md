The termbases contain individual :ToolTip{label="terminological
entries" title="terminological entry" content-id="termpost"}. Each
terminological entry describes one :ToolTip{label="concept"
title="concept" content-id="concept"} and contains one or more
:ToolTip{label="terms" title="term" content-id="term"} naming the
concept.

In the terminological entry, you can find terms in the languages that
are available for the concept being described. The linguistic coverage
varies from termbase to termbase. Most of the termbases contain
terminology in Norwegian Bokmål, Norwegian Nynorsk and English, while
some cover other languages as well. In Settings, you can select which
languages you would like to appear in the terminological entries.

Terms may have different :ToolTip{label="acceptability ratings"
title="acceptability rating" content-id="acceptabilityRating"}. The
:ToolTip{label="preferred term" title="preferred term"
content-id="prefLabel"} is considered the best suited to describe the
concept within the given field. An :ToolTip{label="admitted term"
title="admitted term" content-id="altLabel"} is a synonym that is also
accepted, while a :ToolTip{label="deprecated term" title="deprecated
term" content-id="hiddenLabel"} is not considered suitable. An
:ToolTip{label="obsolete term" title="obsolete term"
content-id="obsoleteTerm"} is no longer in common use, but it can, for
instance, be found in historical materials.

The :ToolTip{label="definition" title="definition"
content-id="definition"} describes the meaning of a concept in a way
that differentiates it from related concepts. In other words, the
definition contains the key characteristics of the concept. Examples
and other additional information can be found in the
:ToolTip{label="note" title="note" content-id="note"} to the
definition. Text excerpts that illustrate how the term is used are
presented in the :ToolTip{label="context" title="context"
content-id="kontext"} field.

A terminological entry can also provide information about the
:ToolTip{label="relations" title="relations" content-id="relation"}
between concepts in the termbase. These relations can be hierarchical,
in the form of either :ToolTip{label="generic relations"
title="generic relation" content-id="genericRelation"} or
:ToolTip{label="partitive relations" title="partitive relation"
content-id="partitiveRelation"}. A concept can also have
:ToolTip{label="associative relations" title="associative relation"
content-id="relatedRelation"}, which designate a non-hierarchical
connection. If the relation is less clear-cut, the related concept can
be listed with a “see also” reference. In some cases, a concept can be
presented as replacing or being replaced by another concept.

If the termbase has a given starting language, the termpost can
specify the degree of :ToolTip{label="equivalence" title="equivalence"
content-id="equivalence"} between the concept in the starting language
and the concept in the target language. The concepts can be fully
equivalent, partly equivalent or not equivalent. For instance, the
meaning of a concept may be narrower in the target language compared
to the equivalent concept in the starting language, making the
concepts partly equivalent.
