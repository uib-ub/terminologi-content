Welcome to Termportalen
::

Termportalen gives free access to Norwegian terminology in a number of
subject fields through one search field. It is possible to search for
terms across different domains, termbases or languages. The termbases
are grouped into overall domains and you may search for terms in
either the whole Termportalen.no, in one specific domain, or in a
selection of termbases. You may also choose a search language in
advance. Most of the termbases contain terminology in Norwegian
Bokmål, Norwegian Nynorsk and English, while some termbases also
contain terminology in other languages as well.

Termportalen is part of the Norwegian Language Collections
(Språksamlingane) at the University of Bergen, and our work is done in
consultation with the Norwegian language council. Termportalen is
funded by the Ministry of Education and Research and the Ministry of
Culture and Equality.
