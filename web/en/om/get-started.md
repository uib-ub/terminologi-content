As part of the digital infrastrucure of Termportalen we have developed
a terminology management application, which is a tool for registering
terminological data. If you want to establish a term group to work on
terminology within a higher education subject field, or in another
domain, please contact us. We will then set up a separate termbase for
you to use.

Before you start working on the termbase, we will give you an
introduction to the terminology management application. We may also
give an introduction to terminological methods, something which is
recommended if the group does not already include members with a
terminological competence. We will of course also offer further
assistance, both on technical and methodological issues as needed.

Please do not hesitate to contact us on :AppLinkContent{to="mailto:termportalen@uib.no"

If you want to get started on terminology work, it is also helpful to
get more knowledge of terminological methods. We recommend
*Termlosen* and the online course *Begrip begrepene*, as
well as our methodology on how to work in term groups:
